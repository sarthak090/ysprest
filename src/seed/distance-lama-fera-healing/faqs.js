    title: `How will Remote/Distance Healing work?`,
    content: `Distance Healing can be explained by phenomena of Quantum Entanglement as an alternative healing therapy to overcome physical, mental, and emotional imbalances. Quantum entanglement discovered by Schrödinger is one of the most significant discoveries of modern science. It states that we all are particles in the universe, entangled together with strong force. Thus, even if we are separated by distance, we are connected and can affect each other’s actions. Albert Einstein quoted this phenomenon as “spooky action at a distance.”

    This interconnection is referred to as ‘Oneness,’ the state of being one. The healers & practitioners, with their expertise, access this unified field of energy & activate the connection. They can alter your energy body with positive vibrations to attract abundance, overcome illness, and improve immunity. The various modalities can help in Integral Healing even at a remote distance.
