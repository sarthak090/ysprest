Therefore, Aura healing comes into play.

  <p> Aura Healing takes care of the negative energy that keeps a soul away from attracting better opportunities. A negative aura keeps the energy of the body low, with a constant feeling of sickness and anxiety. Aura healing nurtures the positive energy present inside the body and focuses on uplifting the vibrations to make a soul happy, cheerful, and optimistic.

Astrology Consultation
For centuries people have built their faith in astrology, which depends on the positions of stars, planets & distinguished constellations. It is believed that these positions of stars & planets play a very important role in determining the future events of life, health & fate. 

Astrology, which talks about the future happenings of life, is mainly based on horoscopes, birth date, time & place. Generally, astrology studies the relationship between significant celestial moments to a group of beings, states or even the entire humanity. Speculating health aspects through astrology and understanding the positions of celestial bodies can guide towards a healthier life. 

        </p>
        <p> Since human organs are also made up of tiny microscopic atoms, body parts inherently become determined by astrological elements. Thus, it becomes easier to relate certain things through astrology. Different stars relate to different organs, like the positioning of the Sun relates with stomach, head and heart whereas the Moon helps us know about the blood and lungs. Learning about uncertainty & malfunction before the actual happening can help with reducing future damage. 
        </p>
        <p>At Your Spiritual Revolution, we consult, suggest & advise gemstones that align with the planetary systems, horoscope & astrology. These gemstones determined after analysing the planetary systems & position of celestial bodies effectively reduce pains, illness, eliminate symptoms and causes of problems further bringing overall well-being and prosperity.
